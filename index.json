Yet the supply chains of poor countries face more frequent disruptions—delivery failures, faulty parts, delays, power outages, theft and government failures—that systematically thwart the production process. To understand how these disruptions affect economic development, we modelled an evolving input–output network in which disruptions spread contagiously among optimizing agents. The key finding was that a poverty trap can emerge: agents adapt to frequent disruptions by producing simpler, less valuable goods, yet disruptions persist. Growing out of poverty requires that agents invest in buffers to disruptions. These buffers rise and then fall as the economy produces more complex goods, a prediction consistent with global patterns of input inventories. Large jumps in economic complexity can backfire. This result suggests why ‘big push’ policies can fail and it underscores the importance of reliability and gradual increases in technological complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Contagious disruptions and complexity traps in economic development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

Examples include the synchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems, markets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in confidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A number of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria separated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behaviour in its normal form as fast–slow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system consists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or patches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such as economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node bifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g. trade couples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves the locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which sudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they can hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades. For an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the model to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data to estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to estimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to spread locally, they also seem to ‘hop' over countries, like in the stylized model; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal network datasets.","tags":["Systemic Risk","Networks"],"title":"Coupled catastrophes: sudden shifts cascade and hop among interdependent systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

We capture seniority of debt in a multiplex network, a graph of nodes connected by multiple types of edges. Here an edge between banks denotes a debt contract of a certain level of seniority. Next we study cascading default. There exist multiple kinds of bankruptcy, indexed by the highest level of seniority at which a bank cannot repay all its debts. Self-interested banks would prefer that all their loans be made at the most senior level. However, mixing debts of different seniority levels makes the system more stable in that it shrinks the set of network densities for which bankruptcies spread widely. We compute the optimal ratio of senior to junior debts, which we call the _optimal seniority ratio_, for two uncorrelated Erdős-Rényi networks. If institutions erode their buffer against insolvency, then this optimal seniority ratio rises; in other words, if default thresholds fall, then more loans should be senior.

This model attempts to capture networks of people who innovate by merging ideas and who solve problems by piecing together solutions. Each person in a social network has a unique piece of a jigsaw puzzle. Acquainted people with compatible puzzle pieces merge their puzzle pieces. More generally, groups of people with merged puzzle pieces merge if the groups know one another and have a pair of compatible puzzle pieces. The social network solves the puzzle if it eventually merges all the puzzle pieces. For an Erdős–Rényi social network with $n$ vertices and edge probability $p_n$, we define the critical value $p_c(n)$ for a connected puzzle graph to be the $p_n$ for which the chance of solving the puzzle equals 1/2. We prove that for the $n$-cycle (ring) puzzle, $p_c(n) = \\Theta(1/\\log n)$, and for an arbitrary connected puzzle graph with bounded maximum degree, $p_c(n) = O(1/\\log n)$ and $\\omega(1/n^b)$ for any $b0$. Surprisingly, with probability tending to 1 as the network size increases to infinity, social networks with a power-law degree distribution cannot solve any bounded-degree puzzle. This model suggests a mechanism for recent empirical claims that innovation increases with social density, and it might begin to show what social networks stifle creativity and what networks collectively innovate.","tags":["Networks","Percolation"],"title":"Jigsaw percolation: What social networks can collaboratively solve a puzzle?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kyu-Min Lee","Charles D.

The banks and investors share a common belief about the future value of certain long-term assets, but they have different objective functions; changes to this common belief result in portfolio adjustments and trade. Positive belief shocks induce banks to buy risky assets from investors, and the banks finance those purchases by issuing new short-term liabilities. Negative belief shocks induce banks to sell assets in order to reduce their chance of insolvency to a tolerably low level, and they supply more assets at lower prices, which can result in multiple market-clearing prices. A sufficiently severe negative shock causes the set of equilibrium prices to contract (in a manner given by a cusp catastrophe), causing prices to plummet discontinuously and banks to become insolvent. Successive positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude do not cancel; rather, a banking catastrophe can occur even if beliefs simply return to their initial state. Capital requirements can prevent crises by curtailing the expansion of balance sheets when beliefs become more optimistic, but they can also force larger price declines. Emergency asset price supports can be understood as attempts by a central bank to coordinate expectations on an equilibrium with solvency.","tags":["Financial Crises","Systemic Risk"],"title":"Inside Money, Procyclical Leverage, and Banking Catastrophes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

Initially introduced on the two-dimensional lattice, the BTW process has been studied on network structures with great analytical successes in the estimation of macroscopic quantities, such as the exponents of asymptotically power-law distributions. In this article, we take a microscopic perspective and study the inner workings of the process through both numerical and rigorous analysis. Our simulations reveal fundamental flaws in the assumptions of past phenomenological models, the same models that allowed accurate macroscopic predictions; we mathematically justify why universality may explain these past successes. Next, starting from scratch, we obtain microscopic understanding that enables mechanistic models; such models can, for example, distinguish a cascade's area from its size. In the special case of a 3-regular network, we use self-consistency arguments to obtain a zero-parameter mechanistic (bottom-up) approximation that reproduces nontrivial correlations observed in simulations and that allows the study of the BTW process on networks in regimes otherwise prohibitively costly to investigate. We then generalize some of these results to configuration model networks and explain how one could continue the generalization. The numerous tools and methods presented herein are known to enable studying the effects of controlling the BTW process and other self-organizing systems. More broadly, our use of multitype branching processes to capture information bouncing back and forth in a network could inspire analogous models of systems in which consequences spread in a bidirectional fashion.","tags":["Networks","Self-Organized Criticality","Systemic Risk","Percolation"],"title":"Bottom-up model of self-organized criticality on networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierre-André Noël","Charles D.

Inspired by cascades of load shedding in coupled electric grids and other infrastructure, we study the Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile model on modular random graphs and on graphs based on actual, interdependent power grids. Starting from two isolated networks, adding some connectivity between them is beneficial, for it suppresses the largest cascades in each system. Too much interconnectivity, however, becomes detrimental for two reasons. First, interconnections open pathways for neighboring networks to inflict large cascades. Second, as in real infrastructure, new interconnections increase capacity and total possible load, which fuels even larger cascades. Using a multitype branching process and simulations we show these effects and estimate the optimal level of interconnectivity that balances their trade-offs. Such equilibria could allow, for example, power grid owners to minimize the largest cascades in their grid. We also show that asymmetric capacity among interdependent networks affects the optimal connectivity that each prefers and may lead to an arms race for greater capacity. Our multitype branching process framework provides building blocks for better prediction of cascading processes on modular random graphs and on multitype networks in general.","tags":["Networks","Systemic Risk","Infrastructure","Power Grids","Self-Organized Criticality"],"title":"Suppressing cascades of load in interdependent networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.
