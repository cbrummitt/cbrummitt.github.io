Our ferries made a triangle so that we could see both islands.\n   Day Itinerary     1 Train to Hyannis, ferry to Martha’s Vineyard. Get settled in the (one and only) campground on the Vineyard.   2 Explore the Vineyard.   3 Ferry to Nantucket, explore Nantucket, and ferry to Hyannis for much cheaper accommodations.   4 Spend a lazy day in and around Hyannis.   5 Bike half the canal rail trail. Look for seals at Coast Guard beach. We camped at Atlantic Oaks.   6 Bike to Provincetown and take a late ferry home.    Day 1: Train to Hyannis, ferry to Martha’s Vineyard, go to the Obamas cove, and see a whaling town Ride the Cape Cod Flyer from South Station. They have cars dedicated to bicycles with racks on the floor. From Hyannis, waste little time in hopping on the ferry (Day 4 offers more time for Hyannis). On the ferry, get a seat on the outside facing west and look for the Kennedy family’s compound on the waterfront.\nGrab lunch in Oak Bluffs, and then explore the town. Make sure to see the gingerbread-like houses at the 1800s-era religious campground. Oak Bluffs is a common destination among Black families.\nUnless you’re springing for the $400/night hotels, get settled at Martha’s Vineyard Family Campground, a short bike ride away. That afternoon, bike to the Obamas’ house. You can’t get close enough to see anything; there’s a private road sign too far from the house. But you might see other tourists trying to do the same.\nThen bike to Edgartown, a former whaling town that drips with charm. The place feels like a fairy tale. We had dinner and beers nearby at Bad Martha Farmers Brewery, which we liked so much we went twice. No matter how dark it is when you leave, it’s safe to ride home to the campground; there’s a separated bike path the whole way.\nDay 2: Vineyard Day This is the longest biking day of the trip. Ride 12 miles to Menemsha, where you can grab a bite of seafood before you hop on the cutest ferry: a pontoon boat where you pay a few bucks. That cuts out a longer detour around Menemsha Pond and drops you off at a gorgeous strip of land overlooking the Vineyard Sound. Then climb up to Aquinnah cliffs for a view of red cliffs and the Gay Head Lighthouse.\nTo make it a loop, bike to Chilmark (where John Belushi spent time as a kid), see what’s going on at the Grange Hall, and stop at galleries to the east of it. If you’re eager for more exploring, continue to Jaws Bridge, named for the film Jaws.\nDay 3: Nantucket Grab an early ferry to Nantucket to maximize time on the exclusive island.\nIt was wicked hot the day we visited, so we grabbed sandwiches at Something Natural (get the lobster sandwich) and then spent a lazy afternoon at Cisco Brewers (which has many food trucks). The bike riding to the south and west of the brewery was hilariously hard due to the sand, but the beaches there (such as Ladies Beach) feel wild.\nThe road in downstown Nantucket is delightfully bumpy:\nTry to time your ferry to Hyannis to overlap with sunset. You can sit on the roof deck and watch the sun go down.\nDay 4: Hyannis If you have just a bit of time in Hyannis, do the self-guided walking tour of the JFK sites. It’s fun to picture the ground assembled at the armory where he gave his acceptance speech.\nIf you spend a day here, we recommend biking to Barnstable in the morning and then to the area near the the Kennedy family’s compound in the afternoon. Grab breakfast at Spoon \u0026amp; Seed on the way to Barnstable, where you can see the old wooden jail, drink a coffee at Nirvana, and ride the little trail that goes from Acre Hill Road to downtown.\nBack in Hyannis, head to the Kennedy compound, where you can get a glimpse from the end of their short, private street. We were there before Joe Kennedy’s election, and all the neighbors were at least feigning their support for the hometown candidate.\nBefore leaving Hyannis, grab a handful of cookies from Kayak Cookies for road snacks.\nDay 5: Bike the first half of the canal rail trail From Hyannis, it\u0026rsquo;s a short 4-mile bike ride to the start of the Cape CoD Rail Trail. This bike path brings you past taco places and breweries as it snakes along the middle of the Cape. We rode it to Atlantic Oaks RV park in Eastham, which is ideally situated right off the path and next to a seafood shack. It\u0026rsquo;s also a couple miles from Coast Guard Beach, a part of the national seashore protected by President JFK where we saw a family of seals parading along the beach.\nDay 6: Wellfleet oysters, Bauhaus homes in the forest, and dinner in P-town On the last day, we ate breakfast at PB Boulangerie, located at the end of the rail trail. Expect a line out the door.\nFrom there, take the coastal road past White Crest Beach, and then turn at Cahoon Hollow Road or Long Pond Road to see the kettle ponds left by the receding glacier. Within this forest are Bauhaus-style cottages built by Walter Gropius and other mid-century modern architechts and designers. Some of these homes are now rented by guests, like the Kugel/Gips house:\nDescend the hill to Wellfleet, a town famous for its oysters, and get a table at Mac\u0026rsquo;s Shack, a seafood restaurant open only in the summer that has New England classics as well as globally inspired dishes. Try the Russian oyster with sour cream and vodka.\nMake sure to bike across Uncle Tim\u0026rsquo;s Bridge and around the island called Cannon Hill. If the tide is low, the marshland under the bridge will be teeming with crabs.\nWe then tried to do an out-and-back to Duck Harbor Beach but didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to visit the beach. After back-tracking to Wellfleet, we took the side road west of Highway 6 to Truro. This section has some hills. You can restock on snacks and water in Truro.\nFrom Truro, you have to bike a short section of Highway 6 before you can turn onto Hughes Road and the much quieter road past the resorts in North Truro. At this point, the Pilgrim monument in Provincetown is coming into view, and you\u0026rsquo;ll soon see men wearing Kaftans and the vibrance of P-town. Before taking the fast ferry back to Boston, we grabbed the lobstah rolls at The Canteen. The big chunks of lobster make it the best in the Cape. If you have another day, the bike ride to Race Point Beach through forest and dunes is not to be missed.\n","date":1675554391,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675554391,"objectID":"d4b816d0fdac906d4ed9ba26c84cb5c6","permalink":"https://cbrummitt.github.io/post/bike-cape-cod/","publishdate":"2023-02-04T15:46:31-08:00","relpermalink":"/post/bike-cape-cod/","section":"post","summary":"Our most salient memory of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was escaping our apartment for a week of biking along Cape Cod and the nearby islands in August.\nOur itinerary We went out on a Sunday and spent 6 days.

Generating large volumes of such credits requires rigorous crediting methodologies. The Soil Enrichment Protocol (SEP) by the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) aims to unlock this type of crediting potential. The SEP includes new expert-driven standards for validating the use of soil biogeochemical modeling to generate credits. Technical experts at Indigo Ag participated in the SEP working group and are supporting implementation of the first project, CAR 1459_RP1, on hundreds of thousands of acres in the US. The authors share their thoughts on new approaches enabled by the SEP as both contributors to the theory behind and practitioners of these approaches. The SEP enables scalable, high-quality credits through four main advances: (1) allowing flexibility in the use of biogeochemical models that meet explicit performance requirements, (2) enabling a new approach to field-level, modeled baselines, (3) supporting a hybrid approach of credit generation using both soil measurement and modeling, and (4) requiring a new type of credit uncertainty quantification that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Together these advances support agricultural credit quantification that enables payments to offset transitional costs for growers, at large enough scales to create a robust market, with a level of rigor that ensures any credited emission reductions have real climate impact. Innovations in soil analyses, advances in research, and improvements in data collection could further improve the potential for agricultural carbon credits to scale.","tags":["Carbon Dioxide Removal"],"title":"Implementing the Soil Enrichment Protocol at Scale: Opportunities for an Agricultural Carbon Market","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

Here, we deploy this method on the task of automating the development of new theory of economic growth. Traditionally, economic growth is modeled with a few aggregate quantities derived from simplified theoretical models. PriSDA, by contrast, identifies important quantities. Applied to 55 years of data on countries’ exports, PriSDA finds that what most distinguishes countries’ export baskets is their diversity, with extra weight assigned to more sophisticated products. The weights are consistent with previous measures of product complexity. The second dimension of variation is proficiency in machinery relative to agriculture. PriSDA then infers the dynamics of these two quantities and of per-capita income. The inferred model predicts that diversification drives growth in income, that diversified middle-income countries will grow the fastest, and that countries will converge onto intermediate levels of income and specialization. PriSDA is generalizable and may illuminate dynamics of elusive quantities such as diversity and complexity in other natural and social systems.","tags":["Economic Development","Machine Learning"],"title":"Machine-learned patterns suggest that diversification drives economic development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

Yet the supply chains of poor countries face more frequent disruptions—delivery failures, faulty parts, delays, power outages, theft and government failures—that systematically thwart the production process. To understand how these disruptions affect economic development, we modelled an evolving input–output network in which disruptions spread contagiously among optimizing agents. The key finding was that a poverty trap can emerge: agents adapt to frequent disruptions by producing simpler, less valuable goods, yet disruptions persist. Growing out of poverty requires that agents invest in buffers to disruptions. These buffers rise and then fall as the economy produces more complex goods, a prediction consistent with global patterns of input inventories. Large jumps in economic complexity can backfire. This result suggests why ‘big push’ policies can fail and it underscores the importance of reliability and gradual increases in technological complexity.","tags":["Economic Development"],"title":"Contagious disruptions and complexity traps in economic development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

Examples include the synchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems, markets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in confidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A number of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria separated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behaviour in its normal form as fast–slow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system consists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or patches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such as economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node bifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g. trade couples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves the locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which sudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they can hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades. For an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the model to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data to estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to estimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to spread locally, they also seem to ‘hop' over countries, like in the stylized model; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal network datasets.","tags":["Systemic Risk","Networks"],"title":"Coupled catastrophes: sudden shifts cascade and hop among interdependent systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

We capture seniority of debt in a multiplex network, a graph of nodes connected by multiple types of edges. Here an edge between banks denotes a debt contract of a certain level of seniority. Next we study cascading default. There exist multiple kinds of bankruptcy, indexed by the highest level of seniority at which a bank cannot repay all its debts. Self-interested banks would prefer that all their loans be made at the most senior level. However, mixing debts of different seniority levels makes the system more stable in that it shrinks the set of network densities for which bankruptcies spread widely. We compute the optimal ratio of senior to junior debts, which we call the _optimal seniority ratio_, for two uncorrelated Erdős-Rényi networks. If institutions erode their buffer against insolvency, then this optimal seniority ratio rises; in other words, if default thresholds fall, then more loans should be senior. We generalize the analytical results to arbitrarily many levels of seniority and to heavy-tailed degree distributions.","tags":["Financial Crises","Systemic Risk","Networks","Percolation"],"title":"Cascades in multiplex financial networks with debts of different seniority","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

This model attempts to capture networks of people who innovate by merging ideas and who solve problems by piecing together solutions. Each person in a social network has a unique piece of a jigsaw puzzle. Acquainted people with compatible puzzle pieces merge their puzzle pieces. More generally, groups of people with merged puzzle pieces merge if the groups know one another and have a pair of compatible puzzle pieces. The social network solves the puzzle if it eventually merges all the puzzle pieces. For an Erdős–Rényi social network with $n$ vertices and edge probability $p_n$, we define the critical value $p_c(n)$ for a connected puzzle graph to be the $p_n$ for which the chance of solving the puzzle equals 1/2. We prove that for the $n$-cycle (ring) puzzle, $p_c(n) = \\Theta(1/\\log n)$, and for an arbitrary connected puzzle graph with bounded maximum degree, $p_c(n) = O(1/\\log n)$ and $\\omega(1/n^b)$ for any $b0$. Surprisingly, with probability tending to 1 as the network size increases to infinity, social networks with a power-law degree distribution cannot solve any bounded-degree puzzle.

The banks and investors share a common belief about the future value of certain long-term assets, but they have different objective functions; changes to this common belief result in portfolio adjustments and trade. Positive belief shocks induce banks to buy risky assets from investors, and the banks finance those purchases by issuing new short-term liabilities. Negative belief shocks induce banks to sell assets in order to reduce their chance of insolvency to a tolerably low level, and they supply more assets at lower prices, which can result in multiple market-clearing prices. A sufficiently severe negative shock causes the set of equilibrium prices to contract (in a manner given by a cusp catastrophe), causing prices to plummet discontinuously and banks to become insolvent. Successive positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude do not cancel; rather, a banking catastrophe can occur even if beliefs simply return to their initial state. Capital requirements can prevent crises by curtailing the expansion of balance sheets when beliefs become more optimistic, but they can also force larger price declines. Emergency asset price supports can be understood as attempts by a central bank to coordinate expectations on an equilibrium with solvency.","tags":["Financial Crises","Systemic Risk"],"title":"Inside Money, Procyclical Leverage, and Banking Catastrophes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

This phenomenon, called self-organized criticality, appears to occur ubiquitously in both nature and technology. Initially introduced on the two-dimensional lattice, the BTW process has been studied on network structures with great analytical successes in the estimation of macroscopic quantities, such as the exponents of asymptotically power-law distributions. In this article, we take a microscopic perspective and study the inner workings of the process through both numerical and rigorous analysis. Our simulations reveal fundamental flaws in the assumptions of past phenomenological models, the same models that allowed accurate macroscopic predictions; we mathematically justify why universality may explain these past successes. Next, starting from scratch, we obtain microscopic understanding that enables mechanistic models; such models can, for example, distinguish a cascade's area from its size. In the special case of a 3-regular network, we use self-consistency arguments to obtain a zero-parameter mechanistic (bottom-up) approximation that reproduces nontrivial correlations observed in simulations and that allows the study of the BTW process on networks in regimes otherwise prohibitively costly to investigate. We then generalize some of these results to configuration model networks and explain how one could continue the generalization. The numerous tools and methods presented herein are known to enable studying the effects of controlling the BTW process and other self-organizing systems. More broadly, our use of multitype branching processes to capture information bouncing back and forth in a network could inspire analogous models of systems in which consequences spread in a bidirectional fashion.","tags":["Networks","Self-Organized Criticality","Systemic Risk","Percolation"],"title":"Bottom-up model of self-organized criticality on networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierre-André Noël","Charles D.

USA 99, 5766 (2002)](https://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/5766)] to multiplex networks, in which a node activates if a sufficiently large fraction of neighbors in any layer are active. We show that both combining layers (i.e., realizing other interactions play a role) and splitting a network into layers (i.e., recognizing distinct kinds of interactions) facilitate cascades. Notably, layers unsusceptible to global cascades can cooperatively achieve them if coupled. On one hand, this suggests fundamental limitations on predicting cascades without full knowledge of a system's multiplexity; on the other hand, it offers feasible means to control cascades by introducing or removing sparse layers in an existing network.","tags":["Networks","Percolation"],"title":"Multiplexity-facilitated cascades in networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.

Inspired by cascades of load shedding in coupled electric grids and other infrastructure, we study the Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile model on modular random graphs and on graphs based on actual, interdependent power grids. Starting from two isolated networks, adding some connectivity between them is beneficial, for it suppresses the largest cascades in each system. Too much interconnectivity, however, becomes detrimental for two reasons. First, interconnections open pathways for neighboring networks to inflict large cascades. Second, as in real infrastructure, new interconnections increase capacity and total possible load, which fuels even larger cascades. Using a multitype branching process and simulations we show these effects and estimate the optimal level of interconnectivity that balances their trade-offs. Such equilibria could allow, for example, power grid owners to minimize the largest cascades in their grid. We also show that asymmetric capacity among interdependent networks affects the optimal connectivity that each prefers and may lead to an arms race for greater capacity. Our multitype branching process framework provides building blocks for better prediction of cascading processes on modular random graphs and on multitype networks in general.","tags":["Networks","Systemic Risk","Infrastructure","Power Grids","Self-Organized Criticality"],"title":"Suppressing cascades of load in interdependent networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles D.
